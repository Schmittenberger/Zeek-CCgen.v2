#if you built zeek from the source repo (https://github.com/zeek/zeek) and with default install dir with make:
/usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek -Cr test/baseline-sample.pcap Zeek-CCgen.v2

# if you installed zeek from binaries it will by default be installed in /opt/zeek/bin/, then use:
/opt/zeek/bin/zeek -Cr test/baseline-sample.pcap Zeek-CCgen.v2

#This will produce a lot of logs.
